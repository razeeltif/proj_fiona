    memories:
    - We forgot about the dishes.
    - My, I need those plates to cook tonight...
    - But I already planned work for this evening!
    - I've so much paperworks to do already.
    - And my comission to finish...
    - I will send it with delay, as usual...
    - And have another evening without any moment to rest...
    - Why do I always plan things so poorly?
    - I don't understand why it seems so hard for me
    - To just act as a normal adult.

    - '...'

    - I feel tired.
    - So tired.
