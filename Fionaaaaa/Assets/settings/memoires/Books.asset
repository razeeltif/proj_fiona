  memoireCalme:
    memories:
    - Sol offered me those books for my birthday.
    - I still haven't finished them.
    - But so far, they're good.
    - Can't wait to pick them up.

  memoireAnxieuse:
    memories:
    - It's been weeks I started to read them, and I'm still far from the end.
    - That's ridiculous... I don't take time to read anymore...
    - I waste so many times, watching series, doing nothing.
    - What's the point to fantasize about any projet if I never take time to do what
      really matters.
    - Plus, I don't honour Sol's gifts... He will think I don't like them, at the
      end.

  memoireColerique:
    memories:
    - Ah, they are still there I see.
    - Of course if I don't tidy up the room, Sol won't do it neither.
