    - Oh, no.
    - There's only that to eat today. Sol must have finished my corn flakes.
    - Too bad, I don't really like this brand. They're a bit too sweet.
    - Well, anyway that's better than nothing!
    - Let's make a bowl.

    - Oh gosh, that's the only box left.

    memories:
    - Oh, f**ck.There's only that to eat today!
    - Sol must have finished my corn flakes. Those one are too sweet...
    - It almost makes me want to puke... How can Sol still like them?
    - I guess he always had such a bad taste. But he knows I don't like those horrible
      things.
    - Why is he always just thinking about himself?!
    - '...Ok, Nola. Calm down. You''re saying nonsense again.'
